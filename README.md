I recently developed a website for the city of Mumbai using HTML and CSS. The HTML provided the foundational structure, organizing content into meaningful sections like the history of Mumbai, popular landmarks, and cultural highlights. CSS was instrumental in bringing the site to life with vibrant colors, stylish fonts, and a cohesive layout that reflects the dynamic spirit of the city. I incorporated animations and effects to enhance user engagement; for instance, I used CSS animations to create smooth transitions for images and text, making the website more interactive and visually appealing. These effects not only added a modern touch but also improved the overall user experience by making navigation intuitive and enjoyable. This project not only deepened my understanding of web development but also allowed me to creatively showcase Mumbaiâ€™s rich culture and heritage.
